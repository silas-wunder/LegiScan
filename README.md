# Analysis of Legiscan Legislation Data

## An application of machine leaning to real world data

Legiscan has catalogued all bills that have been introduced in any body of legislature, both state and federal, since approximately 2009. They also retain all information about how any members of that body voted on bills, as well as some basic information about those representatives. This dataset no doubt can provide lots of interesting insights into how the legislative process works at the state and federal levels, as well as providing information about how well our respresentatives are actually representing us.
