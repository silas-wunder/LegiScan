# Analysis of Legiscan Legal Data

## A basic machine learning practice project

This project exists solely to practice my machine learning skills against real-world data, specifically legal data.
As of right now, the only aspects of this project are a download script that pulls the relevant information from the Legiscan site using their API, expansion to actual analysis will come later.
