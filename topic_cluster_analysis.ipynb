Unfortunately, that only works well with labeled data, which this data is not. We could go through and manually label every topic, but that would defeat the purpose of using an LLM to cluster. Instead, we will just rely on what the model was trained with initially, as this will likely be accurate enough for our purposes. We will use BERT's `all-mpnet-base-v2`, as it is the most accurate without fine tuning and can apply to a wide range of contexts."
