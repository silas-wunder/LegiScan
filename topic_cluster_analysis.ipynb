Unfortunately, that only works well with labeled data, which this data is not. We could go through and manually label every topic, but that would defeat the purpose of using an LLM to cluster. Instead, we will just rely on what the model was trained with initially, as this will likely be accurate enough for our purposes. We will use BERT's `all-mpnet-base-v2`, as it is the most accurate without fine tuning and can apply to a wide range of contexts."

With this narrowing down we can see that it clearly concerns abortion, but if we saw only one of these topics out of context and its cluster we could not easily make the same assumption. Now we have the task of naming each cluster, which isn't a super obvious task with unsupervised learning. One way we can try is finding the topic closest to the center of each cluster and using that as a title."
